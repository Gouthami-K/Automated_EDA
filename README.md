# Automated_EDA

Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques are designed to help data scientists and analysts quickly understand and visualize key aspects of their datasets without manual intervention. 
These techniques generate summary statistics, visualizations, and insights to highlight patterns, distributions, and potential issues in the data.\

## Here are some automated EDA techniques:

## 1.Pandas Profiling: 
Pandas Profiling is a Python library that generates a comprehensive HTML report containing various statistics and visualizations for each column in a DataFrame. It provides insights into data types, missing values, basic statistics, and distributions. Pandas Profiling is particularly useful for quickly understanding the structure and characteristics of the data.\

## 2.Sweetviz:
Sweetviz is a Python library that creates comparison reports between two datasets, typically a train set and a test set. It automatically generates side-by-side visualizations and statistics, highlighting differences between datasets. Sweetviz helps identify changes in data distribution or relationships.\

## 3.D-Tale: 
D-Tale is a library that provides an interactive web interface for visualizing Pandas DataFrames. It allows users to generate various visualizations, explore individual data points, and analyze summary statistics. D-Tale provides an easy way to interactively explore the data without writing code.\

## 4.AutoViz: 
AutoViz is a Python library that automatically generates a wide range of visualizations for a given dataset. It selects appropriate chart types based on the data's characteristics and distribution. AutoViz is helpful for quickly creating a variety of plots to identify trends and relationships.


These automated techniques and tools can be valuable, especially when dealing with large datasets or when you want to for quickly gaining insights into your data. However, it's important to note that these tools are not a one-size-fits-all solution. The efficacy of these techniques can vary depending on the nature of the data and the specific problem you're trying to solve. Manual intervention and domain expertise might still be required for certain cases to ensure that the generated features are meaningful and relevant to the problem at hand.
